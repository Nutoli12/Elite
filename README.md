Elite-Tena is a decentralized medical platform (dApp) leveraging blockchain for secure and transparent patient data management, doctor interactions, and medicine purchases. The platform includes smart contracts, IPFS for storage, React for the frontend, Hardhat for blockchain development, and Metamask for blockchain interactions.
# Sample Hardhat Project
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
